# UK Biobank Ontology Viewer 🌱🔎

Welcome to the **UK Biobank Ontology Viewer**, your interactive gateway to browsing and selecting phenotypes without the hassle of **going back and forth** on the [UK Biobank Showcase](https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/) website. Forget about manually hunting through categories—this tool provides a **clear, visual ontology** of the UK Biobank fields, making it a breeze to pick exactly what you need!

## Overview 🌍

**What Can This Tool Do for You?**  
Instead of navigating through the UK Biobank’s web interface multiple times to find that one perfect phenotype, you can now do it all in one place. Our viewer helps you identify, select, and **export a ready-to-use `field_list.txt`** file, which you can then feed into the **Extractor** tool we mentioned earlier!

## Features 🚀

- **Intuitive Ontology Browsing:** Quickly find categories, subcategories, and fields.
- **No More PDF or Multi-Tab Headaches:** Everything is neatly displayed in a single, user-friendly interface.
- **Direct Phenotype Selection:** Pick your desired phenotypes and export them as a `field_list.txt` file.
- **Seamless Integration:** Once you have your `field_list.txt`, upload it straight into the **UK Biobank Extractor** for effortless data retrieval.

## How It Works ⚙️

1. **Download or Clone the Repo:**  
   **No GitHub experience needed!** Just grab the file that matches your platform or clone the repository if you want to explore the code.

   **Direct Downloads:**
   - 🍏 **Mac** (Executable)  
   - 🪟 **Windows** (EXE)  
   - 🐧 **Linux** (Executable)  

   **To Clone:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/biobankly/UKB-Ontology-Viewer.git
   ```

2. **Run the Application:**  
   - **Windows:** Double-click the `.exe` file.  
   - **Linux:** Make it executable (`chmod +x <filename>`) and run it (`./<filename>`).

3. **Navigate & Select Phenotypes:**  
   Explore the ontology structure:  
   - Click to expand categories and see subcategories.  
   - Drill down until you find the exact field IDs you’re interested in.  
   - Once you’ve made your selections, export them as `field_list.txt`.

4. **Upload to the Extractor:**  
   Take your newly created `field_list.txt` and head over to the UKB Extractor repository we discussed before. Upload it there to start pulling the corresponding phenotype data—no more manual searches!

## Why Use This Viewer? 🤔

- **Time-Saving:** No more tedious back-and-forth on the showcase site.  
- **More Control & Organization:** Visually map out relationships between fields.  
- **Beginner-Friendly:** Even if you’ve never touched a GitHub repo before, you’ll find this easy and straightforward.
