# UK Biobank Ontology Viewer üå±üîé

Welcome to the **UK Biobank Ontology Viewer**, your interactive gateway to browsing and selecting phenotypes without the hassle of **going back and forth** on the [UK Biobank Showcase](https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/) website. Forget about manually hunting through categories‚Äîthis tool provides a **clear, visual ontology** of the UK Biobank fields, making it a breeze to pick exactly what you need!

## Overview üåç

**What Can This Tool Do for You?**  
Instead of navigating through the UK Biobank‚Äôs web interface multiple times to find that one perfect phenotype, you can now do it all in one place. Our viewer helps you identify, select, and **export a ready-to-use `field_list.txt`** file, which you can then feed into the **Extractor** tool we mentioned earlier!

## Features üöÄ

- **Intuitive Ontology Browsing:** Quickly find categories, subcategories, and fields.
- **No More PDF or Multi-Tab Headaches:** Everything is neatly displayed in a single, user-friendly interface.
- **Direct Phenotype Selection:** Pick your desired phenotypes and export them as a `field_list.txt` file.
- **Seamless Integration:** Once you have your `field_list.txt`, upload it straight into the **UK Biobank Extractor** for effortless data retrieval.
